  `cartokit` ships with a compact core of common cartographic forms, with
  support for transitioning between forms without transforming your data.
</Topline>

As a tool for interactive cartography, `cartokit` adopts the language of cartographers to describe layers on your map. Rather than focusing on the appearance of individual marks, `cartokit` gives each layer a **type** that corresponds to a particular cartographic form. A layer's type determines not only which of its visual attributes can be styled, but also how data is mapped to particular attributes for display. This behavior guides you into the pit of mapping success, applying smart defaults and best practices without tedious configuration.

## Layer types

`cartokit` currently supports six layer types. The available layer types for a given layer are dependent on the `geometry` of the input data.

### Point

The **Point** layer type displays all features of a layer as points with a consistent, configurable radius. This type is the default type for `Point` and `MultiPoint` GeoJSON datasets.

#### Supported Input Geometries

- `Point`
- `MultiPoint`
- `LineString` (uses centroid)
- `MultiLineString` (uses centroid)
- `Polygon` (uses centroid)
- `MultiPolygon` (uses centroid)

## Layer type transitions

Many geospatial datasets can be represented using different cartographic forms, and it's not always clear which form best represents your data. Typically, experimenting with diverse forms requires both significant data transformation work and changes to your visualization code. With `cartokit`, these transitions are instant and reversible via the **Layer Type** select, allowing you to explore different representations of your data without writing any transformation code yourself. But don't worryâ€”this code is always included in the generated program, available in the **Editor**.
