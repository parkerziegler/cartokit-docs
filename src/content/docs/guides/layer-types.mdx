<Topline>
  `cartokit` ships with a compact core of common cartographic forms, with
  support for transitioning between forms without transforming your data.
</Topline>

As a tool for interactive cartography, `cartokit` adopts the language of cartographers to describe layers on your map. Rather than focusing on the appearance of individual marks, `cartokit` gives each layer a **type** that corresponds to a particular cartographic form. A layer's type determines not only which of its visual attributes can be styled, but also how data is mapped to particular attributes for display.

## Layer types

`cartokit` currently supports six layer types. The available layer types for a given layer are dependent on the `geometry` of the input data.

### Point

The **Point** layer type displays all features of a layer as points with a consistent, configurable radius. This type is the default type for `Point` and `MultiPoint` GeoJSON datasets.

### Proportional Symbol

The **Proportional Symbol** layer type allows scaling of point symbols based on the value of a selected attribute for each data point. This is one option type for `MultiPoint` and `MultiPolygon` GeoJSON datasets.

### Heatmap

The **Heatmap** layer type displays the density of data using a color gradient with intensity styled by a **Constant** concentration of points or weighted **Range** with selected attribute value. This is one option type for `MultiPoint` GeoJSON datasets.

### Polygon

The **Polygon** layer type displays geographic areas as filled shapes with configurable fill color and border style. This type is the default type for `Polygon` and `MultiPolygon` GeoJSON datasets.

### Choropleth

The **Choropleth** layer type colors polygons based on the value of a selected attribute, either **Categories** or a numerical **Range** with a using a configurable scale. This is one option type for `MultiPolygon` GeoJSON datasets.

### Dot Density

The **Dot Density** layer type distributes points within polygon boundaries, with the number of points proportional to a selected attribute value. This is one option type for `MultiPolygon` GeoJSON datasets.
