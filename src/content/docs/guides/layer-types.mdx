  `cartokit` ships with a compact core of common cartographic forms, with
  support for transitioning between forms without transforming your data.
</Topline>

As a tool for interactive cartography, `cartokit` adopts the language of cartographers to describe layers on your map. Rather than focusing on the appearance of individual marks, `cartokit` gives each layer a **type** that corresponds to a particular cartographic form. A layer's type determines not only which of its visual attributes can be styled, but also how data is mapped to particular attributes for display.

## Layer types

`cartokit` currently supports six layer types. The available layer types for a given layer are dependent on the `geometry` of the input data.

### Point

The **Point** layer type displays all features of a layer as points with a consistent, configurable radius. This type is the default type for `Point` and `MultiPoint` GeoJSON datasets.
