<Topline>
    `cartokit` lets you run and integrate maps seamlessly in your own development environment—no modifications required.

To get the program into your own code editor, click the **Open Editor** button in the bottom right (or press <kbd>E</kbd>), copy the program using the **Clipboard** button in the top right (or press <kbd>P</kbd>), and then paste the program into your editor of choice.

## Real-time compilation 

`cartokit`’s **Editor** is built for near real-time compilation (&lt;20ms). As you adjust the data, basemaps, and layers, the Editor responds instantly—no manual refreshes or re-runs required.

## Code options

The **Options** tab, located at the bottom of the Editor, lets you customize how your map code is generated in `cartokit`. From here, you can switch between **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**, as well as choose your preferred mapping library—either **Mapbox GL JS** or **Maplibre GL JS**.
