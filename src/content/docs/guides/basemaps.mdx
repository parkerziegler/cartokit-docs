<Topline>
    `cartokit` allows you to swap between and upload your own basemaps, giving you quick control over the geographic canvas.
</Topline>

To change your basemap `cartokit`, click the **Basemap Picker** in the **Toolbar** (or press <kbd>B</kbd>) and choose any option. Your current map&apos;s data and layers will remain intact.

## Basemap providers

`cartokit` currently provides basemaps from four providers, as well as the ability to supply our own [OpenMapTiles](https://openmaptiles.org/schema/)-compatible schema from an accessible url.

### CARTO

<a href="https://docs.maptiler.com/cloud/api/authentication-key/"> **CARTO**</a> offers modern basemaps ideal for data visualization and analysis. For non-commercial purposes, these basemaps are free to use and require no additional setup.

### MapTiler

<a href ="https://www.maptiler.com/">**MapTiler**</a> provides a wide range of global and terrain basemaps with detailed vector styling.

<Aside type="caution" title="API Key Reminder">
    MapTiler requires an <a href="https://docs.maptiler.com/cloud/api/authentication-key/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">API key</a> for access. Be sure to configure your own key when using these basemaps outside `cartokit`.
</Aside>

### Stadia Maps

<a href="https://docs.stadiamaps.com/">**Stadia Maps**</a> offers high-quality, fast tiles built for both light and dark interfaces. If you're running via a local development server, you don't need an API key. 

<Aside type="caution" title="Authentication reminder">
    Stadia Maps uses <a href="https://docs.stadiamaps.com/authentication/#domain-based-authentication">domain-based authentication</a>. You’ll need to register your deployment domain with Stadia Maps to enable access. If your map runs outside of a browser, you will need an <a href="https://docs.stadiamaps.com/authentication/#api-keys">API key</a>.
</Aside>

### Stamen

<a href="https://maps.stamen.com/">**Stamen**</a>’s basemaps include creative and artistic styles such as *Toner*, *Watercolor*, and *Terrain*. Stamen Map Tiles are now served by **Stadia Maps** and should follow the same authentication procedures.

## Custom basemap

The Custom tab in `cartokit` allows you to load your own basemap by supplying a URL to any style JSON compatible with the <a href="https://openmaptiles.org/schema/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenMapTiles</a> schema.

The OpenMapTiles schema defines a common structure for vector tiles derived from OpenStreetMap. Each tile is organized into thematic layers that describe how features should be rendered. Because the schema is open and widely adopted, many tools can produce compatible vector tiles and style JSON files that work seamlessly in `cartokit`.
